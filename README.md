FlatteristSMS
=============

This application works with [The Flatterist](http://www.flatterist.com) from Steve Marx. Steve kind enough to expose an API that returns all his compliments.

Essentially, you can send a TXT message to the provided Twilio number and you'll receive a TXT message back followed by a phone call from Steve Marx. You can also send the service the phone number of a friend.

You'll need to replace the following values with your own:

- **YOURSITE** with your own Windows Azure Website CNAME.
- **ACCOUNTNAME** with your own Windows Azure storage account name.
- **ACCOUNTKEY** with your own Windows Azure storage account key.
- **YOURTWILIONUMBER** with your own Twilio phone number.
- **accountSid** with your Twilio account sid.
- **authToken** with your own Twilio auth token.

Enjoy!
